# digitalbooking
Digital booking is a website that allows you to make accommodation reservations categorized into hotels, hostels, apartments and bed &amp; breakfast in different touristic places in Argentine. The site can be used by users to search for accommodation and make reservations and also by administrators, who can also add products. Our objective was to develop a site according to the functionalities required by the client. We emphasized making it responsive, intuitive, and easy navigable, so that users enjoy the experience and return to visit it.
